Pocket Comics Mod 100M free coins Hacks with tickets tricks - Please note that the upgrade applies to a single copy of the card. Just because you upgraded a Hank to the second level doesn't mean all your Hanks will be so powerful! It all depends on whether you are willing to have some high fusion level cards or lower but consistent cards. Continue playing and discover the game style that best suits you. The cost of upgrading is high. If possible, do not upgrade your Commons and Rare. Rare and colors are arranged in ascending order: gray (normal), rare (green), epic (blue), legendary (purple), myth (gold). The rarer a card is, the higher its energy level it can obtain.
